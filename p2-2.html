<h3>The important of Artificial intelligence<h3>
There are exit of many important such as medicial fields , business fields, Everyday life
Firstly, I will talk about The importance of artificial intelligence in the medical field, The healthcare field is evolving rapidly, achieving a significant increase in the amount of data and challenges in terms of cost and patient outcomes; So artificial intelligence applications have been used to reduce these challenges and the most important examples of the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in this field: Prediction of intensive care unit conversions. Patients can be transferred to the intensive care unit in an unplanned manner, which may lead to poor results, and in some cases, it may lead to the death of patients; So artificial intelligence was used to reduce the proportion of these cases, by finding patients with serious cases, where artificial intelligence systems use patients ’medical records, laboratory results, and vital signs to manage patients’ condition before it deteriorates, and having to transfer them to the intensive care unit, and it can guide Artificial Intelligence systems Doctors to the point of initiation of treatment. [2] Medical examination: Performing unnecessary routine lab tests increases unnecessary financial costs; Therefore artificial intelligence applications have been used to narrow the circle of laboratory analyzes that a patient may need. [3] Improve clinical workflow. For some, a mention of artificial intelligence (AI) summons images of robots running amok as humans valiantly try to put the genie back in the bottle. Also the (AI) has many important such as These neural networks are so sophisticated that the path a machine takes to reach its conclusion is not yet readily understood. Deep learning uses huge, self-improving neural networks only possible and more widely accessible because of recent advances in computing power to achieve extremely complex pattern spotting like recognizing speech or images.
