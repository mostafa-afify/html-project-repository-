<h2>What is the Artificial intelligence</h2>

<h4> 
Artificial Intelligence is an ability to design smart machines or to develop self-learning software applications that imitate the traits of the human mind like reasoning, problem-solving, planning, optimal decision making, sensory perceptions etc. The capacity of artificial intelligent approaches to outperform human actions in terms of knowledge discovery gained the attention of business and research communities all over the world and this field of study witnessed rapid progress in the past two decades. let us move ahead in this introduction to AI post in detail.

<h4> what is future is artificial intelligence?
The Future of Artificial Intelligence Artificial intelligence is impacting the future of virtually every industry and every human being. Artificial intelligence has acted as the main driver of emerging technologies like big data, robotics, and IoT, and it will continue to act as a technological innovator for the foreseeable future.Scientists and researchers are working to develop future artificial intelligence that can be greatly beneficial and in multiple aspects of life; Starting from smartphones to cars, or even homes that run on the smart system, and with some future scenarios that artificial intelligence systems may reach in different fields as well as entertainment: a person may watch a movie that he chooses to represent, as artificial intelligence systems may help companies Production based on scenario analysis of a particular film and anticipating the profits that the film might earn when it is shown in cinemas.  </h4>
